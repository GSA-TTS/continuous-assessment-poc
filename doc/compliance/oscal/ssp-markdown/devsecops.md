Describe how code is tested, verified, and committed, including pre-commit checks, linting and code-scanning checks in the developerâ€™s IDE. Identify the workflow steps and how code changes are linked to work items and change requests.
-->

# 10.8.2 Infrastructure-As-Code (IAC) Implementataion
<!--
Instructions: Describe how the infrastructure is maintained.
