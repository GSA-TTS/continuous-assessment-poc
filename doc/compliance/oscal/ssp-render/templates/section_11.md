# 11 System Interconnections
<!--
Instructions: List data covering all interconnected systems in the two tables in this section as described below. Add additional rows as needed. A system interconnection is the direct connection of two or more IT systems for the purpose of sharing information resources (data or services). CIO-IT Security-24-125: Managing Information Exchange Agreements documents the type of agreements required when information is exchanged between systems, including when an Information Exchange Agreement (IEA)/Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) or Interconnection Security Agreement (ISA)/MOA is required. Any IEA/MOA or ISA/MOA between GSA and external entities including off-site contractors or Federal agency/departments must be approved by the GSA CISO.

Note: For system interconnections with an IEA/ISA/MOU, additional information regarding connection may be found in the associated IEA/ISA/MOU.
