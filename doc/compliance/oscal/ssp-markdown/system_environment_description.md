Instructions: In the space that follows, describe the technical system environment, and document the architecture requirements identified within Sections 9.1 through 9.3 of this document. Include information about all system environments that are used, (e.g., production, test, staging or QA environments). Ensure that the proposed software stack utilizes current and supported versions. The software stack, including operating system, application, database, etc. must be configured and hardened in accordance with GSA technical guidelines, NIST guidelines, Center for Internet Security guidelines, or industry best practice guidelines, as deemed appropriate by the GSA AO.
The mechanisms for creating, storing, distributing, and signing any encryption keys or certificates in the system shall be fully documented in the security architecture. Additionally, all keys and certificates generated shall be reposed in a manner that assures Business Continuity Plan (BCP), Disaster Recovery (DR) and Continuity of Operations (COOP) consistent with NIST requirement per impact FIPS 199 impact level. For further details, see CIO-IT Security-09-43: Key Management.
Systems that process Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Payment Card Industry (PCI) data, Authenticators (e.g., passwords, tokens, keys, certificates, hashes, etc.), and other sensitive data as determined by the AO, shall encrypt that data everywhere (i.e., at file level, database level, at rest, and in transit). For web services connections, implement end to end encryption terminating the connection at the web server; connections terminated at a load balancer, Firewall, and/or WAF shall employ re-encryption techniques to ensure end to end encryption.
Encryption of GSA sensitive data (e.g., PII, PCI, Authenticators, other business sensitive data) at rest and in transit shall be with FIPS validated encryption modules wherever possible; exceptions require Acceptance of Risk (AOR) to be signed by the GSA CISO and AO.
