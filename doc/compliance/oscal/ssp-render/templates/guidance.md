# Guidance

In addition to the instructions found throughout the template the following guidance is provided to assist personnel in preparing System Security and Privacy Plans (SSPPs) for General Services Administration (GSA) systems. The SSPP is one of the key documents of an information system’s security package. Once completed, the SSPP provides detailed descriptions of (1) all a system's security control implementations; (2) the system’s purpose, function, and operations, including inventories of its components and services; and (3) detailed depictions of the system’s data flows, architecture, and authorization boundary.

The GSA Office of the Chief Information Security Officer (OCISO) expectations for specific areas in the SSPP are listed below.

*	The latest GSA OCISO SSPP template is to be used by the System Owner (or by proxy) and the system’s Information System Security Officer (ISSO) for documenting each assigned information system’s security and privacy requirements. The completed SSPP must be signed by the following roles for final approval:
    *	GSA System Owner
    *	GSA ISSO
    *	Provider/Vendor ISSO (if applicable)
    *	GSA Information System Security Manager (ISSM)
*	The System Owner and ISSO must ensure all technologies utilized by the information system are included and described thoroughly in Sections 1-12. Each technology and its purpose supporting the information system should be detailed in the General System Description and System Environment section.
*	As part of preparing the SSPP the following documents and subject areas must be completed, reviewed, and approved, or meet the requirements identified.
    *	Privacy determination – a Privacy Threshold Assessment, and a Privacy Impact Assessment, if applicable, must accurately identify if Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is in play.
    *	Security Categorization – a Federal Information Processing Standards 199 template must be completed which identifies all the information types pertinent to the system and the final security categorization with justification if any security impact levels for any information type have been adjusted.
    *	Digital Identity Acceptance Statement (DIAS) – a GSA DIAS must be completed in accordance with the National Institute of Standards and Technology 800-63 series of documents.
    *	Security Architecture Review – GSA OCISO’s Security Engineering Division (ISE) must have approved the security architecture after reviewing it as described in CIO-IT Security-19-95: Security Engineering Architecture Reviews.
    *	The following Authorization to Operate (ATO) Showstoppers must be fully satisfied with implementation details provided for the controls listed. Additional details are provided in the instructions at the beginning of Section 13 of the SSPP.
        *	Multifactor Authentication for Privileged and User-Level Access - IA-02(01) and IA-02(02)
        *	Remediation of Critical and High Vulnerabilities – SI-02
        *	Remote Code Execution Vulnerabilities – SI-02
        *	Usage of End-of-Life Software – SA-22
        *	System Architecture Review – PL-08
        *	Encryption of Sensitive Data (PII, Payment Card Industry [PCI], Authenticators, business sensitive data) everywhere – SC-08, SC-08(01), SC-28, SC-28(01)
        *	Integration with GSA’s Security Stack (Federal Systems)
        *	Compliance with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s Binding Operation Directives and Emergency Directives (BODs/EDs).
*	Control implementation details in Section 13 of the SSPP must provide detailed implementation descriptions across groups of assets/devices within the security authorization boundary.
*	Per CIO-IT-Security 06-30: Managing Enterprise Cybersecurity Risk, the OCISO will review the SSPP to determine if it is complete, consistent, and addresses the security requirements for the information system. Based on the results of the review, the SSPP may require further updating, or may be approved.
