Instructions: In the table below, fill out the applicable details for any external services that integrate with the system. If non applicable, just state there are no external integrations. Use the following bullet list as guidance to accurately populate the services table for each external connection proposed for integration with the information system considered for Authorization to Operate (ATO) consideration.
•	System Name:  Name of external system (SaaS or Corporate Service, etc.)
•	Connection Type:  Describe the type of connection flow as unidirectional incoming, unidirectional outgoing, bi-directional, or none. (Incoming, Outgoing, Bi-directional, none)
•	Data Description:  Provide a description of the data content and classification associated with the connection. Does the data contain government data, PII, CUI, etc.? (Yes/No, (Gov. Data, CUI, Proprietary, etc.)).
•	Data Sensitivity:  Describe the sensitivity of the data (Low, Moderate, High). Include a brief description of how this data was categorized (i.e., FIPS 199, internal corporate processes, etc.).
•	Level of Vendor Dependency: Describe the level of dependency (Low, Moderate, High) on the vendor regarding configuration of support and security control implementation. Include decision logic and how difficult it would be to migrate to an alternative if not approved for use.
•	Alternative Exists:  Does an alternate service exist which performs the same functionality? (Yes/No) If yes, describe the alternate service.
•	Is API over HTTPS: (Yes/No).
•	API Connection Security: (OAuth 2.0, HTTP, Digital Certificates/ TLS Client, SAML, HMAC)
•	API Connection Type:  It is important to recognize that vendors are inconsistent in their use of the term “API key”. It is often used as a stand-in for “tokens”, “codes”, “customer identifiers” depending on the product and usage. The following bullets cover the scenarios:
  ‒	Inbound: An external system uses an API key to communicate with the CSP Infrastructure/Platform API to obtain information about or data from the vendor resources. This scenario is only applicable to external systems requiring connectivity inbound to the CSP.
  ‒	Outbound: A CSP system uses an integration token to communicate with an external system. Sometimes the vendors refer to these as “API Keys”, but this is not an accurate description because they are simply a customer identifier.
  ‒	Sync: An external system uses an API key to communicate with another external system
•	Authentication and Authorization:  Describe how the service authenticates to the system. For example:  User ID and password, Secure Shell (SSH) key, token, SAML federation, etc.  (UID, PW, Key, Token, Federated, User ID + token, etc.).
•	MFA:  Does the service connection require MFA? (Yes/No) If yes, which MFA vendor is being used?
•	Role Based Access Control:  Is Role-based access control implemented for authentication? (Yes/No)
•	Audit Logs Available:  Does the external system provide the capability to generate audit logs that are available to the consumer? (Yes/No)
•	Encryption in Transit:  Is data encrypted during transit (Yes/No)? If yes, what type of encryption is used (i.e., TLS 1.2).
•	Encryption in Storage:  Is the data encrypted at rest (Yes/No). If yes, what type of encryption is being used (i.e., AES 256)? Are the encryption modules FIPS Validated?
