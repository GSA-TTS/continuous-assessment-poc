# sc-28.1 - \[\] Cryptographic Protection

## Control Statement

Implement cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure and modification of the following information at rest on [every asset of the system everywhere, including databases and applications]: [(1) Personally identifiable information; (2) Payment Card Industry data; (3) Authenticators, including but not limited to passwords, keys, and tokens; (4) business sensitive data as determined by the data owner and approved by the GSA CISO and AO].

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[SC-28(01)[01]\] cryptographic mechanisms are implemented to prevent unauthorized disclosure of [(1) Personally identifiable information; (2) Payment Card Industry data; (3) Authenticators, including but not limited to passwords, keys, and tokens; (4) business sensitive data as determined by the data owner and approved by the GSA CISO and AO] at rest on [every asset of the system everywhere, including databases and applications];

- \[SC-28(01)[02]\] cryptographic mechanisms are implemented to prevent unauthorized modification of [(1) Personally identifiable information; (2) Payment Card Industry data; (3) Authenticators, including but not limited to passwords, keys, and tokens; (4) business sensitive data as determined by the data owner and approved by the GSA CISO and AO] at rest on [every asset of the system everywhere, including databases and applications].

## Control guidance

The selection of cryptographic mechanisms is based on the need to protect the confidentiality and integrity of organizational information. The strength of mechanism is commensurate with the security category or classification of the information. Organizations have the flexibility to encrypt information on system components or media or encrypt data structures, including files, records, or fields.

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

<!-- For implementation status enter one of: implemented, partial, planned, alternative, not-applicable -->

<!-- Note that the list of rules under ### Rules: is read-only and changes will not be captured after assembly to JSON -->

### This System

<!-- Add implementation prose for the main This System component for control: sc-28.1 -->

#### Implementation Status: planned

### Cloud.gov

cloud.gov has built-in cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure and modification of data. Customers are responsible for further securing/encrypting any sensitive information in their customer applications, and for auditing the permissions their users have for managing their applications.

#### Rules:

  - app-field-level-encryption

#### Implementation Status: partial

### GitHub Actions

As an additional layer of protection, all PII data is encrypted using [Active Record Encryption â€” Ruby on Rails Guides](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_encryption.html).
This encryption is implemented in a using non-deterministic AES-256-GCM through Ruby's openssl library with a 256-bit key and a random initialization vector {rails crypto module}.

The Data Encryption Key is stored in the credentials.yml file in an encrypted format by Ruby's openssl library using the AES-128-GCM cipher,
and is built into the application package.

The credentials.yml decryption key is stored in GitHub Actions and injected into the running application as an environmental variable. The application then uses this key
to decrypt the credentials.yml file and obtain the Data Encryption Key.

A backup of the key is stored by the Lead Developer and System Owner within a keepass database stored in Google Drive.

#### Rules:

  - properly-configured

#### Implementation Status: partial
