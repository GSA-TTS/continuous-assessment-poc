# Privileged User Access
<!--
Instructions: Provide a brief description of the authentication process for a privileged user. The description should clearly show authentication from an administrative laptop/workstation to the privileged access point or points. This should capture the access for the backend and frontend as applicable. The description should include the technologies (i.e., MFA software, Active Directory, Jumpbox, etc.). The description should capture all privileged access points (i.e., shell/remote desktop protocol (RDP) remote sessions, administrative graphical user interface (GUI), database, etc.). The description should include all credentials used at all authentication points.

# Non-Privileged User Access
<!--
Instructions: Provide a brief description of the authentication process for a non-privileged user. The description should clearly show authentication from a non-privileged user laptop/workstation to system or application access point. This should capture the access for backend and frontend as applicable. The description should include the technologies (i.e., MFA software, Jumpbox, etc.). The description should include all credentials used at all authentication points.
