Provide sufficient information (e.g., System Name, component IP address and interface identifier) connecting to this system. Name the organization and the POC for the external system. For Connection Security indicate how the connection is being secured. For Data Direction, indicate which direction the packets are flowing. For Information Being Transmitted, describe what type of data is being transmitted. If a dedicated telecom line is used, indicate the circuit number.
