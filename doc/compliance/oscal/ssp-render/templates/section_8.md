Instructions: The terms General Support System (GSS) and Major Application are no longer used by NIST. Minor Applications/Subsystems are typically authorized to operate under the authorization of a larger Major Application and do not have a standalone authorization to operate. Systems previously considered a GSS or Major Application should be classified as a Major Information System. Contact ISP at ispcompliance@gsa.gov if there are any questions.

## 8.1 Systems Providing Controls to {{ ssp.system_characteristics.system_name_short }}

<!--
Instructions: List all systems providing controls, the controls they provide, and identify if it is provided as a Common or Hybrid control. Ensure that the interconnections for systems providing controls are included in the network architecture diagram.

Note: Systems can only inherit controls from systems that have a current ATO.
