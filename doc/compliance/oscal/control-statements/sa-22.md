# sa-22 - \[\] Unsupported System Components

## Control Statement

- \[a.\] Replace system components when support for the components is no longer available from the developer, vendor, or manufacturer; or

- \[b.\] Provide the following options for alternative sources for continued support for unsupported components [none (requires an approved Acceptance of Risk Letter)].

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[SA-22a.\] system components are replaced when support for the components is no longer available from the developer, vendor, or manufacturer;

- \[SA-22b.\] [none (requires an approved Acceptance of Risk Letter)] provide options for alternative sources for continued support for unsupported components.

## Control guidance

Support for system components includes software patches, firmware updates, replacement parts, and maintenance contracts. An example of unsupported components includes when vendors no longer provide critical software patches or product updates, which can result in an opportunity for adversaries to exploit weaknesses in the installed components. Exceptions to replacing unsupported system components include systems that provide critical mission or business capabilities where newer technologies are not available or where the systems are so isolated that installing replacement components is not an option.

Alternative sources for support address the need to provide continued support for system components that are no longer supported by the original manufacturers, developers, or vendors when such components remain essential to organizational mission and business functions. If necessary, organizations can establish in-house support by developing customized patches for critical software components or, alternatively, obtain the services of external providers who provide ongoing support for the designated unsupported components through contractual relationships. Such contractual relationships can include open-source software value-added vendors. The increased risk of using unsupported system components can be mitigated, for example, by prohibiting the connection of such components to public or uncontrolled networks, or implementing other forms of isolation.

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

<!-- For implementation status enter one of: implemented, partial, planned, alternative, not-applicable -->

<!-- Note that the list of rules under ### Rules: is read-only and changes will not be captured after assembly to JSON -->

### This System

<!-- Add implementation prose for the main This System component for control: sa-22 -->

#### Implementation Status: planned

______________________________________________________________________

## Implementation for part a.

### GitHub Actions

The continuous_monitoring application is built and supported by the continuous_monitoring DevOps staff.

The application utilizes public open source Ruby and NodeJS components.

The application utilizes dependency scanning tools Bundle Audit and Yarn Audit to find vulnerable or insecure dependencies.

If a vulnerable or insecure dependency is found it will be upgraded or replaced. Additionally the continuous_monitoring team code review processes include a review of the health (up to date, supported, many individuals involved) of direct open source dependencies.

#### Rules:

  - properly-configured

#### Implementation Status: implemented

______________________________________________________________________

## Implementation for part b.

### GitHub Actions

There are currently no unsupported system components within continuous_monitoring. In case an unsupported system component is required to maintain continuous_monitoring, the continuous_monitoring System Owner will be consulted to make a determination in coordination with the continuous_monitoring ISSO and ISSM.

#### Rules:

  - properly-configured

#### Implementation Status: implemented
